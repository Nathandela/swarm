# ADR-007: Remote access — identity, pairing, two-scheme crypto, relay trust, journal, launch authority

**Status**: Proposed (design lock for the remote-control epic `agents-tracker-5h5`; ratifies to Accepted at Phase-1 close. Feeds the implementation plan of record `.claude/tmp/remote-control-implementation-plan.md`, coverage-audited in `docs/verification/audit-003-remote-control-plan.md`.)
**Date**: 2026-07-18

## Context

ADR-004 deferred remote access to "its own ADR: identity, pairing, E2EE/relay trust, idempotency, audit logging," and left "SO_PEERCRED checks per request ... reconsidered in the V2 remote ADR." This is that ADR.

The product: a phone app that interacts with swarm sessions from anywhere — read output, send input, answer permission prompts, interrupt, and (later) spawn — across multiple computers, with push notifications, at the "Claude-app seamless" bar, and "extremely safe" as a hard requirement. The threat model is unforgiving: the phone commands processes that edit code and run tools on personal machines, over the public internet, and a stolen phone or a compromised relay must not become code execution or data exfiltration.

Two prior committee reviews shaped this: audit-002 on the design (E2EE-relay direction accepted; every write feature re-priced; crypto split into two schemes; launch scoped as RCE) and audit-003 on the implementation plan (verdict REVISE; the remote-origin trust tier had no unforgeable basis; several Phase-1 contracts contradicted the source; async-delivery/crash-recovery/connection-lifecycle contracts were unspecified). A delta re-audit (003b) confirmed the plan's D.0 amendments close every finding and green-lit Phase 0, routing four residuals to this ADR. Those four are decided below.

swarm's read path is already remote-ready (transport-neutral schemas F-2, versioned capability-negotiated handshake F-1, namespaced session ids, server-derived status Groups, escape-filtered VT snapshots N-6). Every write feature is new work, and the daemon has no concept of a "remote" client today: the TUI, the hook, and a future gateway all dial the same UDS and reach the identical DaemonAPI.

## Decision

### D1. Transport: self-hosted E2EE relay (Option A), behind an interface

A small stateful relay on a VPS; the daemon-side gateway and the phone both dial outbound TLS/443 (WebSocket); the relay stores and forwards ciphertext only. Chosen over Option D (Tailscale + blind push broker) because it is one coherent product surface (presence, mailbox, push, pairing) and the only shape that matches the cold-start-from-cellular bar. The transport module stays behind an interface so Option D can be adopted as a direct path later without rework. This A-vs-D decision is made here (Option A) and gates the Phase-1 crypto/pairing/relay work; if a future revision picks D, those areas are revisited before implementation, not mid-stream.

### D2. Two crypto protocols

- **Live transport**: Noise XX, suite `Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_SHA256` (SHA-256 for Swift/CryptoKit interop), via `github.com/flynn/noise`. Static keys are the pinned per-party X25519 identity keys; a fresh handshake per connection (no 0-RTT) gives forward secrecy at each boundary; the prologue binds protocol/role/route; peer static keys are compared to the pinned value and the handshake aborts before any transport byte on mismatch (authenticated, not TOFU).
- **Async envelopes**: a machine **epoch content key** model. The machine holds `(epoch_id uint32, K_epoch)`; mailbox events and push wakes are AEAD-encrypted (XChaCha20-Poly1305 — 24-byte nonce, mandatory because K_epoch is reused across events) once under the epoch key and fanned out; the epoch key reaches each active device sealed (nacl `box.SealAnonymous`, crypto_box_seal-compatible — verified present in `golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box`) to that device's long-term key. Revocation rotates to `(epoch_id+1, K_epoch')` and re-grants only to survivors.

No hand-rolled primitives: `flynn/noise`, `golang.org/x/crypto` (nacl/box, curve25519, chacha20poly1305, hkdf), `crypto/ed25519` (stdlib), only.

**Two X25519 keys per phone device, not one** (audit-003 M1 / A14): a Noise-static key and a sealed-box-recipient key, both pinned/stored at pairing (R-PAIR.3/.7, R-DEV.1); the EpochGrant seals to the recipient key, not the Noise static. Reusing one key across both protocols has no demonstrated oracle (neither protocol exposes the raw shared secret) but voids the clean composable argument; a second key is nearly free and buys it back.

**Two epoch keys per epoch — wake vs content** (audit-003 M2 / A15): each EpochGrant delivers a **wake key** (after-first-unlock, app-group-readable by the Notification Service Extension, decrypts only content-free "activity on machine X" push payloads) and a **content key** (biometric-gated, not NSE-readable and not derivable from the wake key, decrypts mailbox session content). A once-unlocked stolen phone yields only the wake key — no session history — closing the content-at-rest exposure. The device long-term and command-signing keys stay biometric-gated.

### D3. Identity and pairing

At `swarm remote init` the machine generates its X25519 identity keypair (Keychain or 0600 file) and an Ed25519 activity-log signing key. The phone generates, in the Secure Enclave / biometric-gated Keychain, its X25519 keys (kept X25519 on the wire — the Enclave cannot do X25519 natively, so a biometric-gated Keychain item or an SE-P-256 key wrapping a stored X25519 key backs it) plus an **Ed25519 device command-signing key** and an Ed25519 relay-auth key.

Pairing (`swarm remote pair`): a single-use 32-byte QR secret (60 s TTL) that never touches the relay — the camera is the out-of-band physical-presence channel; phone and machine meet through an opaque relay rendezvous mailbox and run Noise XXpsk0 with the secret as PSK; a 4-emoji SAS is derived from the handshake channel binding (fixed 64-entry table, identical in Go and Swift); a **mandatory local desktop confirm** (`Allow "<device>"? [y/N]`) is the independent second gate that defeats a photographed/leaked QR, failing closed on no/timeout. Outcome: mutual static-key pinning of both device X25519 keys + registration of the device command-signing and relay-auth public keys. Pairing requires a local console (Phase 1); headless/SSH-only pairing is refused (it collapses the OOB and the confirm into one in-band channel — RCE-via-shell); a headless OOB-code flow is a Phase-3 follow-up.

### D4. Remote-origin authority — the unforgeable basis (residual R1)

The daemon establishes remote origin **by construction, not by a self-declared capability**:

- A **dedicated remote-tier UDS** (`<stateDir>/remote.sock`, 0600), distinct from the owner-trusted main socket. Connections on it are unconditionally remote-tier; the gateway dials only it; a `remote-gateway` capability, if kept, is a non-trust feature flag, never the trust basis.
- **Per-command device signatures**: every remote mutating op carries a detached Ed25519 signature (device command-signing key) over the canonical tuple `(action, machine=endpoint id, session, operation_id, expires_at, content_hash?)`; the daemon verifies it against the pinned device key and the device's capability grant **before** executing. A compromised relay cannot forge commands; only paired, unrevoked devices can issue them; no remote-class mutating op executes on any listener without a valid signature.

**Threat-model scope (residual R1, the honest boundary).** A `0600` socket does not isolate two processes running as the same owner uid, and the gateway must run as the owner (it holds the machine identity key and reads the 0700 state dir), so SO_PEERCRED cannot distinguish a compromised gateway from the local TUI. Therefore the cryptographic containment boundary is the **untrusted relay** and the **semi-trusted phone**: a process compromised while running as the owner (the gateway included) already holds the machine identity key and can act as the owner directly, without the daemon — the same status as a compromised shell on a single-owner machine, and outside the cryptographic boundary by construction. Sidecar isolation (below) limits blast radius on daemon/PTY state (defense-in-depth); it is not a cryptographic barrier. This ADR adopts the scoped threat model for the personal-deployment default and records the stronger option (a dedicated non-owner service uid with its own key custody, or an OS sandbox/MAC profile denying the gateway the main-socket path) as an available hardening if multi-user isolation is later required. Revisiting ADR-004's deferred SO_PEERCRED question: it does not help here because both trusted and untrusted processes share the owner uid.

### D5. Gateway: supervised sidecar

`cmd/swarm-remote` runs as its own process under an external supervisor (macOS launchd LaunchAgent, Linux systemd user unit), never spawned by the daemon; it dials the daemon's remote socket in and the relay out; it holds no state a restart loses except live connections and the persisted `(K_epoch, epoch_id, relay-acked journal cursor)`. It is the only component parsing attacker-influenced relay bytes and must not share an address space with the PTY-owning, agent-spawning daemon.

### D6. Durable journal + two-phase idempotency (in the daemon)

A single daemon-wide append-only journal under `<stateDir>/journal/`, versioned records `(schema_version, cursor uint64, ts, session_id, type, payload)`, written at the `saveMetaLocked` **choke point** (covering `SetStatus`, `finalizeTerminal`, `Launch`, and the two `reconcile.go` startup transitions) plus a separate `Delete` tombstone hook — enumerate the choke point, never the callers. The journal append is a WAL-style step in the same recoverable commit as the meta write (no meta-without-journal or vice versa across a crash), fsync'd before its cursor is acked (D-5). Resume contract: "snapshot as of cursor N, then events after N," atomic. Flap debounce lives at the delivery layer (push-wakes + coalesced snapshots), never in the durable journal.

Idempotency is **two-phase** (residual R2 / audit-003 CRITICAL): a durable `prepared -> executing -> completed/failed` record keyed by `operation_id`, fsync'd **before** the side effect; for launch the `operation_id` is persisted as part of the existing two-phase session reservation (same fsync), so a crash between spawn and commit is resolved by reconcile against the reserved id, not by re-spawning. Replay returns the cached outcome and executes nothing. `interrupt` is **at-most-once** (SIGINT delivery is not verifiable from terminal state): its record resolves to `completed` or, after a mid-interrupt crash, to a terminal `outcome-unknown` state the phone surfaces — never a claimed exactly-once; `kill` (SIGKILL + terminal-state-verifiable) stays exactly-once-verifiable.

The async mailbox `seq` is the durable journal cursor (one coordinate; a gateway restart holds no independent counter). `recipient_key_id` is a routing hint **outside** the AEAD AAD, so the ciphertext under the shared K_epoch is identical for every recipient and the relay's per-device mailbox does the routing. EpochGrants are not in the journal-seq stream; they carry their own `(epoch_id, grant_seq)` per-device anti-replay coordinate and are mailboxed (so an offline-at-rotation device receives its grant on reconnect).

### D7. Input and approval semantics (residuals R3, R4 folded into D6)

Raw `input`/`resize` are **live-only** — they require a live connection holding the current lease generation and are never durably queued or replayed; on disconnect a queued keystroke resolves to an explicit "delivery unknown / not sent." Take-control opens a **signed one-shot `take_control` op** (device signature + a single biometric gate token) establishing a bounded authenticated control session (TTL + explicit end); keystrokes ride that session, not per-keystroke signatures. Discrete ops (interrupt/kill/approve/launch) each carry their own signature + gate token. Only high-level idempotent ops enter the offline queue.

Approval binds an immutable `(machine, session, agent-instance{shim_pid, shim_start_time}, interaction_id, content_hash, expires_at)` tuple, with `operation_id` separated from `interaction_id`, daemon-authoritative expiry (phone countdowns are display-only), a byte-exact content canonicalization + SHA-256 hash, and interaction consumption/supersession state; a stale or mismatched approve is rejected daemon-side and never translated into a blind keystroke. The delivery mechanism (whether a minutes-later decision can be applied to the synchronous in-PTY prompt) is resolved by spike S-C; the binding/validation layer above is Phase 1 regardless.

### D8. Launch authority

Remote launch is the highest-privilege verb (RCE). Authorization is evaluated **before** any argv composition or cwd stat: kill switch on? cwd within a machine-configured allowed root (checked and handed to the shim as the same fully-resolved real path — no check-on-resolved/use-on-original gap)? device capability permits launch? `dangerously-skip-permissions` and full-access options are refused from remote, hard-coded; `Options` are allowlisted (not just `Env` dropped — audit-003 m2); no phone-supplied env (env comes from daemon policy — also the correct fix for the ADR-006 billing-env class); worktree isolation by default; per-device capability policy (read-only / read+approve / full); an explicit phone confirm. Live launch execution is Phase 2; the builder + policy enforcement + crash-recovery are Phase 1.

### D9. Relay: untrusted, with a full account/routing lifecycle

The relay authenticates connections by an Ed25519 relay-auth signed challenge (it never learns the X25519 identity keys), stores per-device ciphertext mailboxes with its own untrusted storage cursor (distinct from the authenticated seq the device trusts), forwards push wakes to APNs with a generic outer payload and ciphertext only, tracks presence and emits a "machine went silent" wake on gateway drop (laptop sleep is a first-class phone state, N-7), and persists to an embedded transactional store (bbolt) holding only ciphertext + routing metadata. It defines: machine registration + routing-id derivation/proof, device authorization scoped to paired routes, an APNs push-token registration/refresh/deletion op, device de-authorization + mailbox purge on revocation (a revoked device keeps neither connectivity nor a drainable pre-rotation mailbox; an offline-at-revoke machine defers the purge to reconnect), duplicate-connection resolution, and day-one rate limits/quotas on every endpoint. TLS is metadata defense only — E2EE confidentiality does not depend on it.

### D10. Kill switch, activity log, connection lifecycle, migrations

A durable kill-switch flag: when off, the daemon refuses every remote-origin op at the boundary (needing neither phone nor relay); `swarm remote off` also severs the gateway; auto-off at zero paired devices. A plain append-only signed activity log for every remote-originated mutation — the signature detects out-of-band edits only (the key is co-located under the same uid; on-machine tamper-proofing would need off-machine anchoring, deferred). A stable machine-readable error-code taxonomy (policy / kill-switch / rate-limit / stale-approval / not-authorized / invalid-field / transient-vs-permanent) that every refusal uses and the phone renders. Client reconnect backoff + jitter on both hops. Versioned migration + rollback tests for every durable artifact (identity, device registry, policy, journal, idempotency, relay DB, activity log). Every TTL is pinned to a single authoritative clock (rendezvous relay-side; idempotency + approval expiry daemon-side).

### D11. Metadata exposure (honesty)

E2EE hides payloads, not metadata. The relay sees which machines and devices exist, connection/presence timing, message sizes and cadence, and push timing; Apple sees push routing and timing. This exposure is documented, retention is bounded (mailbox purge after ack + a cap; presence not persisted), logs carry no bodies, and the "managed hosting leaks nothing" claim is withdrawn.

### D12. Platform and distribution

Native SwiftUI, iOS-first; an Apple developer account ($99/yr) for APNs + NSE is a hard Phase-0 dependency. All protocol/crypto/state logic lives in a gomobile-ready Go phone-core (tested against itself on the build machine); the SwiftUI layer is a thin shell compiled on-device later. A mandatory pre-production Xcode/device gate (archive, gomobile bind, entitlements, killed-app push, NSE timeout, biometric cancel, Keychain-after-reboot) precedes any real-world use — "Go core + uncompiled iOS source complete" is not "shipped," and the on-device key-custody + biometric surface is an aggregated deferred residual risk retired only at that gate. Live Activities and an Android thin client are later. The blind-push-gateway seam (relay cannot hold the APNs signing key if the app is ever distributed) is a conscious deferral, moot for the personal-only build (open question 6).

## Consequences

### Positive
- Compromise containment against the *actual* untrusted components: a hostile relay cannot read, forge, or undetectably reorder anything; a stolen once-unlocked phone yields no session content; a lost phone is revoked with immediate epoch rotation + lease release + relay de-authorization; the kill switch severs everything from the machine alone.
- The read path reuses existing, tested seams (namespaced ids, Groups, N-6 snapshots, lease supersede) unchanged.
- Exactly-once mutating semantics survive daemon crash/upgrade (D-5) via two-phase records; input is honestly live-only rather than pretending to be replayable.
- One coherent product surface; the transport interface keeps Option D open.

### Negative
- You operate an internet-facing stateful relay (mailboxes, cursors, device registry, APNs custody, abuse controls) — not "stateless."
- Two crypto protocols and a per-command signature layer are real implementation and review cost.
- A process compromised as the owner uid (gateway included) is outside the cryptographic boundary on a single-owner machine — documented, with a dedicated-uid/sandbox hardening available but not the default.
- Metadata (presence, timing, sizes) is exposed to the relay and Apple; mitigations (padding/batching) are optional.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Option D (Tailscale + blind push broker)**: dramatically less custom security code (WireGuard is the transport security; identity/revocation are Tailscale's problem), but requires the Tailscale app/account, has iOS VPN reconnect lag on cold open, still needs the daemon journal + a sync protocol, and infers presence rather than brokering it. Kept as the fallback with the better security-effort ratio and reachable behind the transport interface. Options B (pure Tailscale, no push) and C (WebRTC, dies in iOS background) rejected.
- **One X25519 key for Noise-static and sealed-box-recipient**: no demonstrated oracle, but a second key is nearly free and preserves clean composable proofs. Rejected the reuse.
- **In-process gateway**: rejected — the one remotely-reachable parser of attacker bytes must not share an address space with the PTY-owning daemon (audit-002 item 14).
- **Self-declared remote-origin capability**: rejected — a capability offer is negotiation, not authentication; origin is by socket + device signature (D4).
- **Cached-outcome-only idempotency**: rejected — leaves the execute-then-crash re-execution window; two-phase records close it.
- **NSE decrypts session content with the epoch/device key**: rejected — it would expose all current-epoch content to an after-first-unlock key; a content-free wake key separates it.
- **transcript_delta / one-tap structured approval as assumed Phase-1 features**: rejected as assumptions — gated behind spikes S-A/S-B/S-C, which return PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL verdicts that scope Phase 2.

## Spec amendments this ADR governs

`docs/specifications/protocol.md` gains the remote protocol extensions (new negotiated capabilities; additive omitempty `Control` fields incl. `operation_id`/`interaction_id`/`device_sig`/`cursor`/`expires_at` and the `approve` sub-struct; journal/activity/policy/pairing ops) drift-checked field-by-field (GG-7). `docs/specifications/system-spec.md` gains the remote-origin trust tier, the journal/idempotency/kill-switch/activity artifacts, and new invariants ("no remote op executes when the kill switch is off"; "remote mutating ops are idempotent"; "no remote-class mutating op executes without a valid device signature"). Both are amended in the Phase-1 epics that implement each piece, never silently.

## Amendment 2026-07-20 — Relay pre-authentication rate-limiting model (refines D9)

**Status**: Accepted. **Context**: the relay-hardening R1 review
(`docs/verification/remote-phase1-relay-review.md`, findings R1-H1/H2/H3) showed that
keying pre-authentication rate limits by the *presented* relay-auth pubkey is unsafe.
`auth_init` carries an UNPROVEN pubkey (no signature yet), so (a) an attacker floods
`auth_init` presenting a victim's pubkey to exhaust that victim's window — a targeted
lockout; (b) attacker-chosen keys create unbounded per-key rate-limit state — a memory
DoS; and (c) a single global counter charged on each successful auth is monopolizable by
one valid key. All three defeat the "day-one rate limits on every endpoint" intent of D9
for the auth path, on a component whose whole job is to be safe while untrusted.

**Decision** (refines D9's rate-limit obligation; the untrusted-relay threat model is
unchanged):

1. **Connection admission is source-agnostic and first.** A global concurrent-connection
   cap and an idle/handshake read deadline bound fds/goroutines/memory before any auth
   work, independent of any claimed identity.
2. **Pre-signature rate limiting is keyed by TRANSPORT SOURCE** (client IP; per-connection
   only as a fallback when no IP is available), NEVER by the unproven presented pubkey.
   This covers `auth_init` and the unauthenticated rendezvous ops. A per-source window
   bounds one network source; no single source can exhaust another source's or a victim
   identity's budget.
3. **No global auth counter that a single source can monopolize.** If a coarse global
   safety valve is kept at all, its budget is strictly larger than any single source's
   per-window budget; the primary control is the per-source window.
4. **Per-key (per-routing-id) rate limits apply only AFTER signature verification**, where
   the identity is proven (post-auth ops). Those maps are reaped on disconnect and bounded
   by a TTL sweep; the relay MUST NOT retain any per-presented-key state before a signature
   verifies.

**Consequence**: the pre-auth DoS surface is bounded per network source, not per claimed
identity, and no unproven-key state is retained — closing R1-H1/H2/H3. **Test impact**
(tracked, and reframed with review, never silently): `TestRelay_AuthRatePerSource`
asserted per-unproven-key independence (the unsafe premise) and is replaced by a
poison-resistance test (an attacker flooding `auth_init` with a victim's pubkey does not
consume the victim's budget) plus a post-auth per-key fairness test;
`TestRelay_ConnRateLimited` is reframed as the per-source pre-auth limit / coarse global
valve. Findings: `agents-tracker-40o` (H1), `agents-tracker-45s` (H2), `agents-tracker-a0u`
(H3).
